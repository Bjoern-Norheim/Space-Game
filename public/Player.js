//Just like in python, class created with "class className", but now use curly braces instead of colon as in JS
class Player {
    //in JavaScript, class methods do not need "function" in front of them, they are properties of the class
    //methods also do not need to be given "self" as an input, instead always have access to "this" keyword which has same functionality

    //constructor is the analogous function to __init__ in python
