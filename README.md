## Some basic git reminders:
### To get the latest code on your machine, in terminal type

`git pull --rebase`


### To contribute your code, in terminal

`git add .`

`git commit -m "my commit message"`

`git push`

### Remember; the two are and should be related!
Make sure to pull the current code before pushing your own online
Before pulling, make sure your current stuff is commited.
There's loads of other things to know but these are the very basics.
